Understand the Problem

Before answering a question (in an inteview or somewhere else), understand what the question is asking you to do. DO NOT JUMP STRAIGHT INTO THE CODE!

Some Guidelines:
    1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?

    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

    4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you are set about solving the problem. That is okay; it is still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

    5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

Ex.
    Write a function takes two numbers and returns their sum. (follow guidelines)

    Can I restate the problem in my own words?
        "Implement addition to return the sum of the numbers."

     What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        - ints?
        - floats?
        - what about string for large numbers?
    
    What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
        - ints?
        - float?
        - string?

    Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you are set about solving the problem. That is okay; it is still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
        - Clarify with interviewer!
        - Ask questions and edge cases.
    
    How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
        - Start by being explicit.
        - Label function sum (be clear).
        - Include two parameters, num1 and num2.
        - return sum (can have a sum variable)
