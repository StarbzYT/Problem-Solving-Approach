Break the Problem Down

In an interview, write notes or steps to solve the question before jumping to the code. This demonstrates an understanding of the process and shows the interviewer how you think, which sometimes is much better than solving the question and not communicating anything at all. 

* Explicitly write down the steps you need to take!

Ex.
    Same question as before; write a function that returns the count of each character in a string.

    def charcount(string):
        # make dictionary with lowercase keys to return at the end
        # loop over sting
            # if the number/letter is already in the dict, add one to the value for that key
            # if the number/letter is not in the dict, make a key for it and set one to be it's value
            # if char is something else (period, space, hashtag, etc), skip over it
        # return dict

    If you couldn't finish the question in time, the steps still show you knew where you needed to go and that is much more valuable than skipping over the break down.

    charcount("Hi my name is Adarsh")
    # {h: 2, i: 2, m: 2, y: 1, n: 1, a: 3, e: 1, s: 2, d: 1, r: 1}
